          <h5>I. Information We Collect</h5>
          <p>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. If your company has engaged BalancedWork to perform Services as outlined in an Agreement, or if you use app.balancedwork.ai to import your work Calendar, then we also collect <strong>Personal Information</strong>. Personal Information includes your work email and any work calendar information which you may share through BalancedWork’s web application hosted on this site. </p>
          <p>1.   <em>Information collected via Technology</em></p>

To use the Service thereafter, you need to submit further Personal Information, which may include work calendar information. In an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. </p>
          <p>The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.  </p>

          <h5>II. How We Use and Share Information</h5>
          <p>‍<em>Personal Information:</em></p>
          <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, so that those services can be performed according to our agreements with those vendors. Examples are the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>The Personal Information you provide to us through the Service is used only in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the BalancedWork Platform. For example, we use Personal Information to generate insights and recommendations, as well as to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, and provide technical support.</p>
          <p>We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms and Condition, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
          <p><em>Non-Personal Information</em></p>
          <p>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.</p>
          <p>In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices.

          <p>We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
          <h5>IV. Your Rights Regarding the Use of Your Personal Information</h5>

Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h5>V. Links to Other Websites</h5>
          <p>As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service. To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.</p>
          <h5>VI. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h5>
